# Dice Waltz Project Proposal

## Team Members:
- Charlie Loveall 
- Briana Staples
- Brienne Cole

## Objective:
### Summary
Create an interactive website that allows users to automatically generate short, classical music pieces by "rolling the dice" (random dice rolling generator).

#### Dataset collection
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qnQVK17DNVkU19MgVA4Vg88zRDvwCRXw/view. - classical music files of a digital piano from numerous resources.

#### Machine Learning
Our proposal is to use a randomly generated dice rolls with a machine learning neural network to compose classical shorts. We can then test these against known classical pieces from our favorite composers.

#### Website
Deploy our interactive website using Heroku which will allows users to click the "roll dice" button to generate their own randomly composed classical short.
